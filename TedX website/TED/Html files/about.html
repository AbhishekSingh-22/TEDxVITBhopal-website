                TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading.
                Started as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, TED has
                grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual
                TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak
                for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available,
                free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall,
                Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe
                Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman.
                <br>
                <br>
                The annual TED Conference takes place each spring in Vancouver, British Columbia. TED's media
                initiatives include TED.com, where new TED Talks are posted daily; TED Translators, which provides
                subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as translations from volunteers worldwide; the educational
                initiative TED-Ed. TED has established The Audacious Project that takes a collaborative approach to
                funding ideas with the potential to create change at thrilling scale; TEDx, which supports individuals
                or groups in hosting local, self- organized TED-style events around the world, and the TED Fellows
                program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to amplify the impact of their
                remarkable projects and activities.
